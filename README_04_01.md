# Application class
Application class. Application is a base class that contains global application state for your entire app.

Timber uses the Application class because the whole app will be using this logging library, and the library needs to be initialized once

> Note that Android Studio may show binding errors and unresolved-reference errors until you rebuild the app.
After open, cannot build this app.
So, I restarted and cleaned caches about Android Studio, and Re-build project.
Then, this app cloud be built.
